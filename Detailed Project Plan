1. Project Scope and Objectives
Objective: To track the success of trading strategies and evaluate the performance of trading signals over time.
Key Features:
Data collection: Import data from live or historical trade signals.
Data storage: Store trade data and results in a structured format.
Data processing: Clean and preprocess the data.
Data analysis: Calculate success metrics and evaluate the performance of signals.
Data visualization: Display insights via graphs, charts, and tables.
Outcome: A comprehensive tool to track, analyze, and visualize trade signal success over time, identifying trends, patterns, and key insights.
2. Stakeholders
Primary Users: You (as the developer and analyst).
Other Stakeholders: If applicable, others who might use the tool (for example, a team or a larger community).
3. Technical Requirements
Programming Languages: Python (for data processing, analysis, and visualization).
Libraries:
Pandas (for data manipulation),
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization),
NumPy (for calculations),
SQL (for database management),
Requests or WebSocket (for live data, if applicable).
Data Storage:
Relational Database (like PostgreSQL or SQLite).
APIs/External Services:
API for fetching trade data (e.g., from exchanges, brokers, or trading platforms).
4. Milestones & Deadlines
Week 1-2:
Complete project setup, including repository, folder structure, and basic project plan.
Gather initial requirements for data sources and APIs.
Set up data collection and storage systems.
Week 3-4:
Implement data processing logic (cleaning, filtering, and preprocessing).
Begin working on metrics for success evaluation (e.g., success rate, win/loss ratio).
Week 5-6:
Develop and refine data analysis logic.
Integrate automated trading signals evaluation.
Week 7-8:
Implement data visualization features (charts, graphs, tables).
Final testing and bug fixes.
Week 9-10:
Prepare documentation and deployment.
5. Development Phases
Phase 1: Setup

Set up the project repository (GitHub).
Create a structure for the codebase (folders for scripts, data, outputs, etc.).
Initialize database (PostgreSQL or SQLite) for storing data.
Phase 2: Data Collection

Import historical data (CSV or API).
Set up data retrieval scripts for live data (if applicable).
Store trade signal data in the database.
Phase 3: Data Processing

Clean the data (remove missing values, format dates/times, etc.).
Process the data for relevant analysis (filter trades, calculate metrics).
Phase 4: Data Analysis

Calculate success metrics (win percentage, average profit/loss, etc.).
Implement functionality to track metrics over time.
Identify patterns in trade signal success.
Phase 5: Data Visualization

Create graphs and charts to represent the analysis.
Implement a dashboard or report generation functionality.
Phase 6: Finalization and Testing

Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of data processing and analysis.
Perform integration testing for the entire pipeline.
Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

Prepare documentation for setup, usage, and analysis results.
Deploy the solution, either as a local tool or a web-based app.
6. Resources and Tools
Development Tools:
IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
Git for version control.
Docker for containerization (optional for deployment).
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite.
API Access: For live data, you might need API keys and access.
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for interactive charts).
7. Risk Management
Risk: Data inconsistencies or missing data points.
Mitigation: Ensure proper error handling and data validation.
Risk: Integration issues between data collection and processing.
Mitigation: Break down tasks into smaller milestones and test frequently.
Risk: Resource constraints (time or computing).
Mitigation: Prioritize critical features and implement in stages.
8. Evaluation and Success Metrics
Trade Signal Performance Metrics:
Win rate (percentage of successful trades).
Profit/Loss per trade.
Total profit/loss over a time period.
Code Quality Metrics:
Code coverage (unit tests).
Number of bugs/issues reported.
